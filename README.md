# IRIS_DATASET_KNN
KNN Algorithm on Iris Dataset.


The analysis begins with loading the classic iris dataset and converting it into a data frame for ease of manipulation.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed using a heatmap to visualize feature correlations and pair plots to explore relationships and distributions among features, differentiated by target classes. 
Box plots further illustrate feature distributions across target classes, while a count plot displays the distribution of target variable classes. Using GridSearchCV, hyperparameter tuning for the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier optimizes parameters for maximum accuracy.
The best model's performance is evaluated using a classification report, presenting precision, recall, and F1-score metrics for each class in the iris dataset.
